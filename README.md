Summary: Manhattan and Brooklyn are the best locations for success in the New York short-term rentals market, regardless of the specific property types being considered.


Context: Pillow Palooza is a fictitious start-up focused on disrupting the traditional real estate market by offering short-term rental options, including entire homes/apartments, private rooms and shared rooms, for travelers. The company has seen a significant increase in demand for short-term rentals in New York City, but wants to better understand the market in order to optimize their business strategy.

My task was to provide insights into the short-term rental market in New York City using data from Airbnb, a competitor. In a competitive market, my goal was to help Pillow Palooza identify opportunities for growth and success and give my recommendations to the company leadership, including the CEO, VP of Data, Head of Finance, and Head of Marketing.



Result: Entire homes/apartments were the most commonly offered and the second most frequently booked property type. These rentals were projected to generate the highest estimated revenue over the next year and were the most reviewed by clients. The neighborhoods and boroughs with the highest popularity and revenue-generating potential were Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan and Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Manhattan and Brooklyn remained the best locations for the other property types to thrive, however, with lower revenue-generating potential.

Recommendation: Efforts should be focused on the entire home/apartment property type in either Manhattan or Brooklyn, with a particular emphasis on the Hell's Kitchen area in Manhattan and/or Williamsburg in Brooklyn. These locations show promising potential for success and growth in the short-term rental market.
